      <h6 id="read">The origin of fashion designing dates as far back as 1826. Charles Frederick Worth is believed to be
        the first
        fashion designer of the world, from 1826 to 1895. Charles, who was earlier a draper, set up a fashion house in
        Paris. It was he who started the tradition of fashion houses and telling his customers what kind of clothing
        would
        suit them.

        During this period, a number of design houses began to hire the services of artists to develop patterns for
        garments. Patterns would be presented to the clients, who would then place an order if they liked them. It was
        during this timeframe that the tradition of presenting patterns to the customers and then stitching them began,
        instead of the earlier system wherein the finished garments would be presented to them.

        In the beginning of the 20th century, new developments in fashion would take place in Paris first, from where
        they
        would spread to the rest of the world. New designs of clothes would be born in Paris before they found their way
        to other parts of the world. In other words, Paris emerged as the 'fashion capital'. 'Fashion' during this
        period
        was mostly 'haute couture', exclusively designed for individuals.

        Towards the mid-20th century, fashion garments began to be mass-produced. The bulk of production increased, and
        people began to have more choices of garments. Towards the end of the 20th century, fashion awareness among
        people
        increased, and they began choosing clothes for themselves based on comfort and their own style, instead of
        relying
        on the trends prevailing in the market.

        Today, as stated above, fashion designing is well accepted as a career option. A number of institutes have come
        up
        the world over, offering courses in various arenas of fashion. The number of students who consider fashion as a
        serious career and who have gone in for courses in the same has gone on rising over the years.
